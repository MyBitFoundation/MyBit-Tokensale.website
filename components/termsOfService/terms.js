purchasing MYB** and the information contained in these Terms; (ii) have access to, and knowledge
of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of the purchaser's particular financial
situation, a purchase of MyB and the **risk to loose the entire amount designated to purchase MYB
(see in particular Sections 5 and 18 of these Terms**); (iii) have sufficient financial resources and
liquidity to bear all of the risks of purchasing and holding of MYB and (iv) be able to evaluate (either
alone or with the help of an adviser) possible scenarios for economic, technological and other factors
that may affect the purchaser's holding of MYB and the risks relating to such purchase/holding.
Before acquiring any MYB, each prospective purchaser should have understood the Terms and be
familiar with them, the MyBit Platform, the MyBit Network, the MyBit Project and the MyBit Foundation.
By participating in the distribution of MYB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have
carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MYB
and agree to be bound by these Terms.\n\n

**1. Introduction**

  1.1. The following terms and conditions (**Terms**) govern the distribution (**MyBit Token
Distribution**) of the cryptographic fuel – the **MyBit Tokens (MYB)** – that is required
to run distributed applications and may only be used on the MyBit network (**MyBit
Network**) to purchasers of MYB (Purchasers collectively and Purchaser
individually). The MyBit Token Distribution is conducted by the MyBit Foundation in
formation (MyBit Stiftung, **MyBit Foundation (Seller)**).
**This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any
way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.**
MyBit Tokens are **exclusively offered for distribution to Swiss residents** (whose
citizenship does not preclude them from a purchase). If a Purchaser is a citizen, tax
resident, green card holder or equivalent **of a country other than Switzerland**, in
particular the United States of America, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia or a
member state of the European Union or the EEA, **he or she shall not participate
in the MyBit Token Distribution**. By participating in the distribution of MYB, you
expressly acknowledge and represent that you have **carefully reviewed the Terms**
and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing MYB and agree to
be bound by these Terms.
As set forth further below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent
permitted by law, that you are authorized to purchase MYB, are of a legal age to be
bound by these Terms, and will not hold the Seller, MyBit AG (MyBit Ltd), any of
their affiliates, officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees, advisors,
attorneys and suppliers, now or in the future and any other member of the MyBit
Team (collectively the **MyBit Parties**) liable for any losses or any special, incidental,
or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the distribution
of MYB.
**Only these Terms apply to the MyBit Token Distribution. All other sources of
information, including but not limited to any whitepapers and the like shall
neither be binding nor taken into account when considering purchasing
MyBit Tokens.**

  1.2. The MyBit Network is being developed by a volunteer contributor team and will
continue to be developed on a volunteer basis by some developers as well as
under a more formalized contracting or employment relationship for other
developers. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be,
employed by, or contracted with **MyBit Ltd** and/or the MyBit Foundation, which both
are currently being established, is termed the **MyBit Team**.

  1.3. As described further below, distributed applications on the MyBit Network require
MyBit Tokens. In order not to create unnecessary entry barriers, it is intended, to
the extent technically feasible and permitted under any applicable laws and
regulations, to accept various means of payment (both, fiat currencies and
cryptocurrencies) to settle transaction fees on the MyBit Network (it being
understood that, on the back-end, computational steps will still require MyBit
Tokens to fuel the operations).

**It is to be noted that ownership of MyBit Tokens gives no right or claim
express or implied to receive any fee, profit and/or revenue share, be it
against the Seller or any other person or legal entity.**

**As of today, it remains unclear whether the MyBit Network will ever be fully
functional and whether there will ever be operations carried out on the MyBit
Network. Hence, it is unclear as to whether the MyBit Token will ever become
functional. Any Purchasers should therefore carefully consider the significant
risk to loose the entire amount used to purchase MyBit Tokens (see in
particular Sections 5 and 18 of these Terms).**

  1.4. Parties may be interested in purchasing MYB (the cryptofuel) in the MyBit Token
Distribution to power distributed application services on the MyBit Network or to
support the development of the MyBit Network.

**It is to be noted, though, that MyBit Tokens may only be used on the MyBit
Network for specific applications provided on this network. It is therefore no
currency or money, be it fiat or not.**

**Individuals, businesses, and other organizations should carefully weigh the
risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring the cryptofuel early in the MyBit Token
Distribution versus waiting to purchase MyBit Tokens once the system is
operational and when they or their businesses actually require the cryptofuel
to operate.**

**2. WARNING: MYBIT TOKENS ARE OF A NON-FINANCIAL NATURE**

  2.1. Being merely the virtual fuel for running the MyBit Network, by nature MyBit Tokens
**are not and shall in no case be understood, deemed, interpreted or construed
as**:\n\n
a. any kind of currency or money, whether fiat or not;\n\n
b. equity interest, voting or non-voting securities (or its like) in, or claims against,
the Seller or any other entity or person in any jurisdiction;\n\n
c. equity or debt investment of any kind in any venture;\n\n
d. any securities having intrinsic value or market price;\n\n
e. any form of financial derivatives;\n\n
f. any commercial paper or negotiable instrument;\n\n
g. any form of investment contract between the relevant holder and any other
person;\n\n
h. any commodity or asset that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase; or\n\n
i. any note, bond, warrant or other certificate that entitles the to interest, dividend
or any kind of return from any person.\n\n

2.2. Ownership of MYB carries **no rights express or implied**. Purchases of MYB are
**non-refundable**. Purchasers should have **no expectation of influence over
governance of the MyBit Network**, the MyBit Ltd, the MyBit Foundation or any of
the MyBit Parties or any other part of the MyBit project.

2.3. MYB is not, and is not intended and/or expected to become, a crypto currency. In
particular, MYB (i) cannot be, and are not meant to be exchanged for goods or
services (other than on the MyBit Network) and (ii) has no known uses and is not
intended to have any use outside the contemplated MyBit Network. The Seller
takes no responsibility that the MyBit can, now or in the future, be acquired, sold or
traded on any known exchange or similar platform.

**3. WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE MYBIT TOKENS IF YOU ARE NOT AN
EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS**

3.1. Purchases of MYB, the MyBit Network’s cryptofuel, should be undertaken only by
individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and
understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchainbased software systems.

3.2. While the MyBit Team will provide general guidelines for user usage and storage of
MYB before the MyBit Network becomes operational, Purchasers should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with
other cryptographic tokens. While the MyBit Team will be available to assist
Purchasers of MYB during and after the distribution, the Seller will not be
responsible for lost MYB resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchasers.
Note, in particular, that MYB Purchasers should take great care to write down their
wallet password and not lose it so as to be sure that they will be able to access their
MYB when it becomes available after the MyBit Token Distribution.

3.3. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase
MYB or participate in the distribution of MYB.

**4. WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS OF VALUE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY IN PRICING**

4.1. Cryptographic tokens that have been assigned a certain value in public markets,
such as bitcoin (**BTC**) or Ether, just to name two well known tokens with – contrary
to MYB – a currency function, have demonstrated extreme fluctuations in price over
short periods of time on a regular basis, in particular sharp losses of value within a
very short period of time. A Purchaser of MYB should be prepared to expect similar
or even bigger fluctuations, both down and up, in the price of MYB, in particular in
view of the limited purpose of MYB as cryptographic fuel. Such fluctuations are due
to market forces and represent changes in the balance of supply and demand. The
Seller cannot and does not guarantee any functioning market or any liquidity for
MYB and therefore there may be periods of time in which it will be difficult or
impossible to buy or sell MYB or to exchange it into other assets, be it other
cryptographic fuels, a cryptocurrency such as BTC or other (physical or digital)
assets. Additionally, due to different regulatory dictates in different jurisdictions and
the inability of citizens of certain countries to open accounts at exchanges located
elsewhere in the world, the possibility to use, buy sell or trade MYB may be
significantly different in different countries and this would likely be reflected in
significant price discrepancies.

4.2. By purchasing MYB, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully
understand that MYB may experience volatility in pricing and will not seek to hold
any of the MyBit Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or
consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to the distribution of
MYB.

**5. WARNING: THE PURCHASE OF MYBIT TOKENS IS EXTREMELY RISKY**

5.1. The purchase of MYB carries with it a number of risks. The following list is not
exhaustive, and potential purchasers should, prior to purchasing MYB, inter alia,
carefully consider the more detailed description of the risks listed below in
Section18 and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant,
or tax professional. If any of the following risks are unacceptable to you, you should
not purchase MYB.

* **Risk of Failure of The MyBit Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value
of the Ether Distribution Revenue**\n\n
* **Risk of Losing Access to MYB Due to Loss of Wallet**\n\n
* **Risk of Unauthorized Access to a Downloaded Wallet**\n\n
* **Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions**\n\n
* **Risk of Alternative, Unofficial MyBit Networks**\n\n
* **Risk of Insufficient Interest in the MyBit Network or Distributed Applications**\n\n
* **Risk Associated With the Development of Other Platforms For
Decentralized Applications**\n\n
* **Risk that the MyBit Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the
Expectations of Purchaser**\n\n
* **Risk that the MyBit Network May Never be Completed or Released**\n\n
* **Risk of Theft**\n\n
* **Risk of Security Weaknesses in the MyBit Network Core Infrastructure
Software**\n\n
* **Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of
Cryptography**\n\n
* **Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand for MyBit Tokens**\n\n
* **Risk of Need of Additional Liquidity or Capital**\n\n
* **Risk of Additional Competition**\n\n
* **Risk of Regulatory Changes/Violations of Law and Regulations**\n\n
* **Risks Relating to Technologies Employed**\n\n
* **Risks Relating to Adverse Publicity, Opposition and Regulatory Inquiries**\n\n

5.2. By purchasing MYB, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to
hold any of the MyBit Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or
consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the distribution of
MYB, including losses associated with the risks set forth below.


**6. What is the MyBit Network?**

6.1. The MyBit Network is designed to enable the rapid building, testing, and
deployment of decentralized wealth management applications on the Ethereum
Blockchain (**MyBit Projects**). Since it relies on smart contract technology it’s main
intended benefit is the ability to connect transacting parties without the need for a
broker, money transmitter or other form of intermediary.

6.2. Payouts for MyBit Projects (dividends, revenue sharing, etc.) shall also be governed
and executed directly by the smart contracts so a third-party service is not needed
to determine, process and/or settle payments to investors.

6.3. The MyBit Network is, to the extent technically feasible and permissible under any
applicable laws and regulations, intended to be deployed initially to facilitate the
building of decentralized wealth management applications on Ethereum’s
Blockchain, but might be applied across many businesses later on.

**7. MyBit Token Distribution**

7.1. A limited amount of thirty-six and a half (36.5) million MyBit Tokens shall be
available for distribution for a maximum period of up to 365 calendar days, with
one-hundred (100) thousand tokens allocated per 24 hour period (day) (**the Token
Distribution Period**).

7.2. Purchasers in the MyBit Token Distribution will acquire MYB in exchange for Ether
as follows\n\n
a) Each 24 hour period (day), for the total duration of the distribution lasting a
maximum of 365 days, one-hundred (100) thousand MYB will be allocated to
contributors. The amount of MYB received varies based on the total Ether
contributed during each period. The formula to determine how much a
Purchaser will receive is as follows: (your Ether contribution/total Ether
contributed) * 100,000

7.3. In order to purchase MyBit Tokens, one option shall be available to Purchasers.

7.4. Purchasers must have the Metamask browser extension and access to an internet
connection. They must navigate to td.mybit.io and follow the instructions to
contribute in the token distribution. At the end of each period, allocated tokens are
available for manual withdrawal. **Purchasers should be aware that participation
in the MyBit Token Distribution by contribution of Ether to the Etherum Smart
Contract is only possible from the token distribution dashboard (td.mybit.io)
with the Metamask browser extension. Other wallets will not accept / be able
to store the MyBit Tokens sent to such wallet by the Etherum Smart Contract.**

7.5. As the MyBit Network is not yet fully functional, the **MYB might have to be
exchanged in order to be compatible with the MyBit Network currently being
developed**. In such case, the MYB will be redeemed in the future on a 1 to 1 basis
(or equal/proportionate amount if the total supply of MYB shall be changed in the
future for any reason, as the Seller may think fit) for the actual MyBit network token
necessary to fuel the operations on the MyBit Network once fully developed.

**8. Previous MyBit Token Distribution**

Purchasers should note that the Seller has offered, as of August 17, 2017, other
selected purchasers to acquire MYB in exchange for 10,044 Ether. (**Previous
MyBit Token Distribution**).

**9. Timing of Distribution**

9.1. The MyBit Token Distribution will begin at 12:00 UTC on 1 January 2019.

9.2. It is the Seller’s current intention that the MyBit Token Distribution shall run for a
maximum period of 365 days.

9.3. The **Seller reserves the right to change the date when the MyBit Token
Distribution will begin and further reserves the right to extend** the distribution
duration for any reason, including the unavailability of the website https://td.mybit.io
or other unforeseen security or procedural issues. Though it does not currently
anticipate doing so, the **Seller also reserves the right to shorten the distribution
duration for any reason.**

**10. Number of MyBit Tokens**

10.1. A maximum of One-hundred and eighty (180) million MYB will be created, up to
thirty-six and one-half (36.5) million of which are available during this MyBit Token
Distribution.

**11. Purchase of MyBit Tokens from the MyBit Website**

11.1. The Seller will maintain a store interface, which can be used to purchase MYB. The
store interface will be available on the MyBit website (https://td.mybit.io).
Instructions for purchasing MyB with https://td.mybit.io using the store interface will
be embedded and available for review on the MyBit website during the duration of
the MyBit Token Distribution.

11.2. Failure to follow these instructions may limit, delay, or prevent a Purchaser from
obtaining MYB. Any questions about these instructions should be directed to Email
info@mybit.io.

**12. Obligation to Determine If Purchaser Can Purchase MYB in Purchaser’s Jurisdiction**

12.1. The MyBit Token Distribution constitutes the distribution of a software product under
Swiss law. This product distribution is conducted by the Seller, operating under
Swiss law.

12.2. It is the responsibility of each potential Purchaser of MYB to determine if the
Purchaser can legally purchase MYB in the Purchaser’s jurisdiction.

**13. Acceptance of Terms and Conditions of the MYB Distribution**

13.1. As a first step in the purchase process, the Seller will present the Purchaser with
these Terms, and associated documents, along with a checkbox. By clicking the
checkbox and/or transferring the purchase price for any purchased MYB, the
Purchaser:

a. consents and **agrees to the Terms**;

b. represents and warrants that the Purchaser is legally permitted to purchase
MYB (in particular, that **he is not subject** to any of the **limitations** set forth at
the beginning of these Terms and in Section 18 (Distributions Restrictions);

c. represents and warrants that the Purchaser is of a **sufficient age** to legally
purchase MYB or has received permission from a legal guardian who has
reviewed and agreed to these Terms;

d. represents and warrants that the Purchaser will take **sole responsibility** for
any restrictions and risks associated with the purchase of MYB as set forth
below;

e. represents and warrants that Purchaser is not exchanging Ether (ETH) or other
tokens or currencies for MYB for the purpose of **speculative investment**;

f. represents and warrants that the Purchaser is acquiring MYB for the use of
**decentralized application services** or the purchase of tokens specific to
forthcoming decentralized applications on the **MyBit Network**, or to facilitate
development, testing, deployment and operation of decentralized applications
on the MyBit Network; and

g. represents and warrants that the Purchaser has an understanding of the usage
and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based software systems
and understands the risks involved in a purchase of MyBit Tokens, in particular
**the risk to loose the full amount** disbursed for the **purchase of the MYB**.

**14. Purchaser’s Loss of the Purchase Wallet Will Cause the Loss of the
Purchased MyBit Tokens**

14.1. As part of the purchase process, the Purchaser will need to receive and store with
Metamask (**Purchase Wallet**).

14.2. Purchaser must keep the Purchase Wallet safe and not share it in any way or with
anybody. Purchaser must make copies of the Purchase Wallet and securely store
backup copies of the Purchase Wallet in multiple locations. The Purchase Wallet is
essential for accessing the Purchaser’s MYB. Purchaser’s loss of the Purchase Wallet will cause the loss of the purchased MYB. Unauthorized access by any party
to a Purchaser’s Purchase Wallet, will enable that unauthorized party to access the
purchased MYB and the MYB will be lost.

14.3. By purchasing MYB, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Purchaser
agrees not to hold any of the MyBit Parties liable for any losses or any special,
incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to,
Purchaser’s failure to properly store, secure and keep private the Purchase Wallet.

**15. MyBit Tokens Will Only Be Available For Distribution on the MyBit Website**

15.1. The Seller will only sell MYB through the MyBit website, available at https://mybit.io/. To the extent that any third-party website or service offers MYB for
distribution during the MyBit Token Distribution or facilitates the distribution or
transfer of MYB in any way during the MyBit Token Distribution or at any time up to
the MyBit Token Distribution, such third-party websites or services are not
sanctioned by the Seller or its parents and affiliates and have no relationship in any
way with the MyBit Parties. As a result, the Seller prohibits the use of these thirdparty websites or services for the purchase of MYB prior to the end of the MyBit
Token Distribution.

15.2. Purchasers should take great care that the site used to purchase MYB has the
following universal resource locator (**URL**): https://mybit.io/.

15.3. Please ensure that the URL of your web browser indicates that it is using a
hypertext transport protocol secure connection (“https”) as depicted above and that
the domain name is correct.

15.4. By purchasing MYB, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Purchaser
agrees not hold any of the MyBit Parties liable for losses incurred by any person,
entity, corporation, or group individuals or groups who uses a third party service to
purchase MYB.

15.5. The only official and authorized MYB distribution website URL is https://mybit.io.

**16. The Seller Will Not Purchase MYB During MyBit Token Distribution**

16.1. The Seller warrants that it will not purchase MYB in its own distribution. Any of the
Seller’s (or MyBit Ltd’s) employee’s, directors, agents, board members of members
of the trustee board, may, however, purchase MYB.

16.2. The Seller warrants that it will not purchase MYB from any third party, or acquire
MYB in any manner, or acquire future control of MYB, during the period of the MyBit
Token Distribution.

**17. Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of MyBit Tokens**

The purchase of MYB carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing MYB, the
Purchaser should carefully consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary,
consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to determining whether
to purchase MYB.

**17.1. Risk of Dissolution of The MyBit Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value
of the Ether Distribution Revenue**

All Purchasers are paying Ether to purchase MYB. It is possible that the value of
Ether will drop significantly in the future, depriving the Seller of sufficient resources
to continue to operate. In order to guard against this risk, the Seller might, at its sole
discretion, periodically convert (partially, or in full, as the Seller may think fit)
proceeds from the distribution of MYB into fiat currencies instead of Ether.

**17.2. Risk of Losing Access to MYB Due to Loss of Wallet**

17.2.1. As noted above, MYB will be stored in a wallet, which can only be accessed with a
password selected by the Purchaser. If a Purchaser of MYB does not maintain an
accurate record of the Purchaser’s password or looses its wallet file, this will lead to
the loss of MYB.

17.2.2. As a result, Purchasers must safely store their password and the wallet file each in
one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location.
Additionally the password and the wallet should never be stored together.

**17.3. Risk of Unauthorized Access to a Downloaded Wallet**

17.3.1. Any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s wallet may potentially access
the wallet by deciphering or cracking the Purchaser’s password. To guard against
any improper access to the wallet, the Purchaser should select a highly secure
password for the Purchaser’s MYB wallet.

17.3.2. Purchaser must take care not to respond to any inquiry regarding their purchase of
MYB, including but not limited to, email requests purportedly coming from the
https://mybit.io or similar looking domain.

**17.4. Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions**

Cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies have been the subject of regulatory
scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the globe. The MyBit Network and
MYB could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action,
which could impede or limit the ability of the Seller or the MyBit Parties to continue
to develop the MyBit Network.

**17.5. Risk of Alternative, Unofficial MyBit Networks**

Following the MyBit Token Distribution, and the development of the initial version of
the MyBit Network, it is possible that alternative unofficial MyBit-based networks
could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open
source protocol underlying the MyBit Network. The official MyBit Network may
compete with these alternative, unofficial MyBit-based networks, which could
potentially negatively impact the MyBit Network and MYB. MyBit Parties may gain a
competitive advantage being the party that developed the MyBit Network, but such
advantages are far from absolute.

**17.6. Risk of Insufficient Interest in the MyBit Network or Distributed Applications**

It is possible that the MyBit Network will not be used by a large number of external
businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public
interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of
interest could impact the development of the MyBit Network and potential uses of
MYB. The Seller has contracted with developers to help build the MyBit Network
and is working with other third-party developers around the world to create an
interest in the MyBit Network. However, it cannot predict the success of its own
development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.

**17.7. Risk Associated With the Development of Other Platforms For Decentralized
Applications**

17.7.1. The Seller is one of several organizations, companies, and groups, attempting to
build a platform which would facilitate the creation and deployment of decentralized
applications. It is possible that different technical paradigms than the ones being
used in the current MyBit Network implementation are optimal.

17.7.2. Competition from these alternative platforms for decentralized applications may
impact success of the MyBit project and the ability of the Seller to operate and sell
MYB in the future.

**17.8. Risk that the MyBit Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of
potential clients**

The Purchaser recognizes that the MyBit Network is presently under development
and may undergo significant changes before release. Purchaser acknowledges that
any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the MyBit Network may not
be met upon release of the MyBit Network, for any number of reasons including a
change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the
implementation of the MyBit Network.

**17.9. Risk that the MyBit Network May Never be Completed or Released**

Purchaser understands that while the MyBit Team will make reasonable efforts to
complete the MyBit software, it is possible that an official completed version of the
MyBit Network may not be released for technical or other reasons or that the
functionality of the MyBit Network is significantly limited due to bugs, technical
flaws, lack of system integrity or other reasons and there may never be a partially or
fully operational MyBit Network.

**17.10. Risk of Theft**

17.10.1. Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the Ether revenue
from the MyBit Token Distribution, thus potentially impacting the ability of the Seller
to develop the MyBit Network. To account for this risk, the Seller has and will
continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the Ether
obtained from the distribution of MYB.

17.10.2. Multi-factor security measures will be taken to protect Ether and MYB including
physical elements, Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm, multi signature keys, BIP 32,
anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds, hot/cold wallet partitioning and
diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be
conducted by internal and external teams.

**17.11. Risk of Security Weaknesses in the MyBit Network Core Infrastructure Software**

17.11.1. The MyBit Network rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the MyBit
Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the MyBit Parties, may
introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the MyBit
Network causing the system to lose MYB stored in one or more Purchaser accounts
or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the MyBit Network.

17.11.2. The Seller has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure, to the extent possible,
the infrastructure of the MyBit Network, and will continue to do so after the MyBit
Token Distribution. For example, the Seller intends to hire external consultants on a
periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the MyBit Network and will work
with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to
audit the Platform.

**17.12. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography**

17.12.1. Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over
time advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of
quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the MyBit Network,
which could result in the theft or loss of MYB.

17.12.2. To the extent possible, the Seller intends to update the protocol underlying the
MyBit Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate
additional security measures, but cannot it cannot predict the future of cryptography
or the success of any future security updates.

**17.13. Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand for MyBit Tokens**

If the MyBit Network is rapidly adopted, the demand for MYB could rise
dramatically. Under such a scenario, the entire MyBit Network could become
destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn,
this could dampen interest in the MyBit Project and MYB.

**17.14. Risks associated with the Ethereum protocol**

MYB and the MyBit Network are based upon the Ethereum protocol. As such, any
malfunction, breakdown, abandonment, unintended function or unexpected
functioning of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the
MyBit Network and/or MYB.

**17.15. Risk of Need of Additional Liquidity or Capital**

The MYB offering may not be completed for various reasons and/or might be
terminated which may lead to a shortage of available financial means for the MyBit
Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Network. In addition, the MyBit
Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Network may need additional
liquidity and/or capital in the future which may not be available on favorable terms
or at all.

**17.16. Risk of Additional Competition**

The markets in which the MyBit Network intends to operate are highly competitive
and some of its potential future competitors may have substantially greater
financial, technical, marketing or development resources than the MyBit Network
and, in some cases, greater name recognition, more experience or better customer
reach.

**17.17. Risk of Regulatory Changes/Violations of Law and Regulations**

Changes in applicable laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, violations of
such laws and regulations or future changes could cause the MyBit Project to incur
significant costs and adversely affect its development and/or operations. Further,
the MyBit Project, the MyBit Foundation and/or the MyBit Network may be subject
to unexpected tax burdens which could cause the MyBit Project to incur significant
additional costs and adversely affect its development and/or operations or its
attractiveness to future customers or users.

**17.18. Risks Relating to Technologies Employed**

The technologies employed by the MyBit Network are still evolving and the MyBit
Network may face unexpected challenges in the development, deployment and
operation of its service offerings. Further, the operations the MyBit Network will rely
on complex IT systems and networks, which can be susceptible to malfunctions and
interruptions. The MyBit Project will use open source software that may subject its
products and services to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes
to be open source software or source code release requirements. Changes to data
protection laws and regulations and their interpretation may impact the
development and operations of its services. The growth of its business and
potential revenue, if any, will depend on the uncertain development of new markets
for newly developed products, solutions and services, which are still evolving, and it
is uncertain whether its products and solutions will achieve and/or sustain high
levels of demand and market acceptance.

**17.19. Risks Relating to Adverse Publicity, Reputation and Regulatory Inquiries**

Adverse publicity about, political opposition to, reputational issues relating to, or
regulatory inquiries into, blockchain technology, crypto fuels and/or token
distributions could inhibit the growth of the overall market in general and the MyBit
Project in particular.

**18. All Purchases of MyBit Tokens Are Non-Refundable**

All purchases of MYB are final. Purchases of MYB are non-refundable. By
purchasing MYB, the purchaser acknowledges that neither the Seller nor any other
of the MyBit Parties are required to provide a refund for any reason, and that the
Purchaser will not receive money or other compensation for any MYB that is not
used as cryptofuel or remains unused.

**19. Taxation of MyBit Tokens and Taxation Related to the MyBit Token
Distribution**

19.1. The Seller makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the
distribution of MYB or the possession or use of MYB. The Purchaser bears the sole
responsibility to determine if the purchase of MYB with Ether or cryptocurrencies
such as BTC or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of MyB over
time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the Purchaser’s home jurisdiction.

19.2. Purchasing MYB, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not hold
any of the MyBit Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the

21.2. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the MyBit Parties warrant that the process for
purchasing MYB will be uninterrupted or error-free.

**22. Limitations Waiver of Liability**

22.1. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any
applicable law, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all
damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to use of, or inability to use,

jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of
contract or tort (including negligence) and that none of the MyBit Parties shall be
liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages,
including for loss of profits, goodwill or data, in any way whatsoever arising out of
the use of, or inability to use, or purchase of, or inability to purchase, MYB.

22.2. The purchaser further specifically acknowledges that MyBit Parties are not liable,
and the purchaser agrees not to seek to hold any of the MyBit Parties liable, for the
conduct of third parties, including other purchasers of MYB, and that the risk of

22.3. To the extent permissible under applicable laws, under no circumstances will any of
the MyBit Parties be liable to any purchaser for more than the amount the
Purchaser have paid to the Seller for the purchase of MYB.

22.4. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation
or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the above
limitations in this section and elsewhere in the Terms may not apply to a Purchaser.
In particular, nothing in these Terms shall affect the statutory rights of any
Purchaser or exclude injury arising from any willful misconduct or fraud of the MyBit
Parties.

implausible.\n\n

25.2. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to
perform may elect to suspend the distribution according to these Terms, in whole or
part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party experiencing
the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in
all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured party.

**27. Distribution Restrictions**

27.1. The MyBit Tokens are exclusively offered for distribution to Swiss residents (whose
citizenship does not preclude them from a purchase). If a Purchaser is a citizen, tax
resident, green card holder or equivalent of a country other than Switzerland, he/
she/it shall not participate in the MyBit Token Distribution.

27.2. Applicable laws may restrict the distribution of these Terms (and the distribution or
offering of any The MyBit Tokens) in certain other jurisdictions, in particular the
United States of America, member states of the EU and the EEA, Canada, Hong
Kong, Japan or Australia. No action has been taken by the Seller that would permit
any offer of the MYB or possession or distribution of these Terms or any other
publicity material or documentation regarding the MYB in any jurisdiction where
action for that purpose is required. Persons into whose possession these Terms

individuals associated with any MyBit Parties, past and present and during the
MyBit Token Distribution.

**29. Severability**

The Purchaser and the Seller agree that if any portion of these Terms is found
illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or
unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other
manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms
which shall continue to be in full force and effect.

**30. No Waiver**

30.1. The failure of the Seller to require or enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of
any provision of these Terms or the Seller’s failure to exercise any right under these
agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Seller’s
right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.
